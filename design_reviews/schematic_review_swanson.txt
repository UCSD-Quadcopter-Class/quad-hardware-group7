Ground symbols should alwasy point down.
VCC (and other power symbols should always point up)
// VCC & GND are now oriented correctly

VCC should be called 3V
Your pull up on SCL and SDA need to be from the the lines to 3V.  Yours are in series with the bus lines.
// Fixed pull up wiring

Did you build your owr ucontroller symbol?
// no

the 1Uf caps in the motor controller should be 0.1uf
// fixed

Flyback and filter are connected across all your motor controllers.
// fixed

Double check the orientaton of your balun and which pins from the ucontroller are connected where.  Compare to red board schematic.
// triple checked

The cap and resistor in your motor controller input filters are wrong:  The cap should be between the PWM line and GND. The resistor should be on the path from the microcontroller to the capacitor and the mosfet.
// fixed (again) see brd review.
