commit 0311a5c422b5d14d150f2adc88ca5faaa71fff88

You need to reroute your board with the new 4pcb-66board.dru.  

You've got some width problems in your radio driver that you've approved in DRC that you should not have.

I would adjust the restrict on your IMU package to eliminate those approved warnings.

The layout of your oscilator is little differet than what's on the redboard.  In yours, the signal from the oscilator goes through one of the cap pads.  IN the red board layout, the caps hang off the side, and there's a direct line from the oscilattor to the uCtrlr.

The trace from C11 to the Balun is a little long. 

One Pad for R3 overlaps with a wire leaving a little triangle of open space.

I just noticed that your custom LEDs are 0603. Soldering them is a little challenging. 0805 is better.

you've got power underneath your IMU.  USe a cutout.

Your decoupling caps are a bit far away from your IMU and your microController.  I know it's hard to get them really close, because the caps are large, but a little closer would be better.

If you want to attach your quad to the test stand, put two 2.5mm holes along the midline of the quadcopter.  this will make bring up and testing easier.

I'm a little nervous about the width of your motor grippers.  1.73mm is a little narrow and maybe prone to breaking

you've got no reset button.

your resister and cap in yoru motor drivers are still in the wrong order in your schematic.

Eagle lint does not pass.
