Board
  Fits within the range V
Attenna
  3V layer running under the attenna controller X
  Trace is extra thick between attena and balun 18mil V
  Caps close V
  Short Trace V
  Group and Layer 2 V
  Vias surrond attenna driver V
  Pours do not completely surround the attena driver V
  Ample Space around Attenna V
  Does it match (maybe)
  No Traces routed through V
Power and Ground
  VBAT runs over all 4 motors V
  VBAT wide enough V
  3V runs under micro and near IMU V
  Bat_gnd and GND are good V
  Power Both in the same layer (15) V
  Nothing narrow V
  Does the VBAT power plane extend to the battery connector ?
IMU
  Centered V
  Very close capacitors V
  IMU on Y axis V
  Only ground under the IMU V
  Some traces under the IMU, but not in the IMU proper X
Headers
  FTDI headers are facing the wrong direction X
Microcontroller
  Resonator is good V
  Decoupling caps are not close the power of microcontroler V
    So this is fine for current understanding of decoupling caps
Power Supply
  Voltage regulator caps are good V
  Volt reg near bat connector V
  3V power runs under all V
Motor Drivers
  On all motors, filtered connections may need to be high voltage X
  Delete the filtered/flyback tags, then double check trace thickness
Mechanics
  Motor cups are 8.4mm V

Miscellaneous
  VBAT by volt reg is high current V
  Extra lines on layer 2 and 15 for bat_gnd and vbat
